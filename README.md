# Diffusion Model Conditioned On Native Data Domain
This is a method for image reconstruction based on a diffusion model which is conditioned on the native data domain. This method is applied to multicoil MRI and quantitative MRI reconstruction. This code is an example for single coil MRI reconstruction using diffusion model conditioned on k-space domain.
